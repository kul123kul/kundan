# P2PLending Smart Contract

## Vision

The **P2PLending** smart contract enables decentralized peer-to-peer lending, allowing lenders to offer loans to borrowers with specified interest rates. This contract ensures secure and transparent transactions by handling the transfer of funds and tracking repayment status, eliminating the need for intermediaries.

## Features

- **Lend Funds**:
  - Lenders can issue loans to borrowers, specifying the loan amount and interest rate, with the contract tracking repayment status.
- **Repay Loan**:
  - Borrowers can repay loans, including interest, to the lender. The contract calculates the repayment amount and marks the loan as repaid once the payment is complete.

## Future Scope

1. **Collateralized Loans**:

   - Introduce collateral mechanisms to reduce lender risk by requiring borrowers to lock assets.

2. **Credit Scoring System**:

   - Implement a decentralized credit scoring system to assess borrower reliability based on repayment history.

3. **Automated Loan Enforcement**:
   - Add automated penalties or actions if the borrower fails to repay the loan by the deadline.

The **P2PLending** contract simplifies decentralized lending, creating a secure environment for borrowers and lenders to interact without intermediaries.
